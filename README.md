# The Project

A backend project where I got to build my own API through Heroku. 
The project has a several of RESTful endpoints which returns either an array of books or a single item. 

# Express API

Available endpoints:

Search books by author: /books?author= "author"
Search books by title: /books?title= "title name"
Search books by ID : /books/ "id number"
Search books high to low: /books?sort=rating_dsc
Search books low to high: /books?sort=rating_asc
